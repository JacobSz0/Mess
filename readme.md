This is an application to quickly create a simple FastAPI database with password implementation. Here are the steps to start it.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the template-maker folder and type "npm start"
2. Wait for the browser to open and fill in the fields for the names of the database. When in any table data field, be sure to use lowercase names only and separate by commas. NO SPACES!
3. Click "Download Python File" and drag the app.py file to the FastAPI-Starter folder (top-level directory)
4. In your terminal, navigate back to the FastAPI-starter folder and type "uvicorn app:app --reload"
5. Open "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/" in your browser, and you should be good to go!
